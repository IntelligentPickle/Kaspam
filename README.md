# Kaspam

Kaspam (great name i know) is a small program that can flood a Kahoot game with bots. It's meant to be an alternative to other flooders.


++WARNING++
This program really isn't that good. Use at your own risk.


## How to use


Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/IntelligentPickle/Kaspam/`

Enter the repo and change the game ID in `kaspam.js`

`cd kaspam-master && your_editor_here kaspam.js # The game id can be changed on line 8`

And run!

`node.`

You should now see bots filling the game. Granted, it's slow, but it works for now. :P
